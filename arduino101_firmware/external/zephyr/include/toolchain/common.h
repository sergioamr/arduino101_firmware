DESCRIPTION
Macros to abstract compiler capabilities (common to all toolchains).

\NOMANUAL
 */

/*
 * Generate a reference to an external symbol.
 * The reference indicates to the linker that the symbol is required
 * by the module containing the reference and should be included
 * in the image if the module is in the image.
 *
 * The assembler directive ".set" is used to define a local symbol.
 * No memory is allocated, and the local symbol does not appear in
 * the symbol table.
