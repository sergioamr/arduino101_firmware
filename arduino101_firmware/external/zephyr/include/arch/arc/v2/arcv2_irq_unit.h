 * WARNING:
 *
 * All APIs provided by this file must be invoked with INTERRUPTS LOCKED. The
 * APIs themselves are writing the IRQ_SELECT, selecting which IRQ's registers
 * it wants to write to, then write to them: THIS IS NOT AN ATOMIC OPERATION.
 *
 * Not locking the interrupts inside of the APIs allows a caller to:
 *
 * - lock interrupts
 * - call many of these APIs
 * - unlock interrupts
 *
 * thus being more efficient then if the APIs themselves would lock
 * interrupts.
