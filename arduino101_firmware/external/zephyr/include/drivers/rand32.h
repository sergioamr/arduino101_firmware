DESCRIPTION
This header file declares prototypes for the kernel's random number generator
APIs.

Typically a BSP should enable the hidden CUSTOM_RANDOM_GENERATOR configuration
option and provide its the implementations for sys_rand32_init() and
sys_rand32_get().
However, if it does not do so a project requiring random numbers must implement
these routines, or (for testing purposes only) enable the TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR
configuration option.
