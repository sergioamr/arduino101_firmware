/**
 * @file
 * @brief mutex kernel services
 *
 * This module contains routines for handling mutex locking and unlocking.  It
 * also includes routines that force the release of  mutex objects when a task
 * is aborted or unloaded.
 *
 * Mutexes implement a priority inheritance algorithm that boosts the priority
 * level of the owning task to match the priority level of the highest priority
 * task waiting on the mutex.
 *
 * Each mutex that contributes to priority inheritance must be released in the
 * reverse order in which is was acquired.  Furthermore each subsequent mutex
 * that contributes to raising the owning task's priority level must be acquired
 * at a point after the most recent "bumping" of the priority level.
 *
 * For example, if task A has two mutexes contributing to the raising of its
 * priority level, the second mutex M2 must be acquired by task A after task
 * A's priority level was bumped due to owning the first mutex M1.  When
 * releasing the mutex, task A must release M2 before it releases M1.  Failure
 * to follow this nested model may result in tasks running at unexpected priority
 * levels (too high, or too low).
