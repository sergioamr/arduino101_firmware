DESCRIPTION
This module implements the microkernel server, which processes service requests
from tasks (and, less commonly, fibers and ISRs). The requests are service by
a high priority fiber, thereby ensuring that requests are processed in a timely
manner and in a single threaded manner that prevents simultaneous requests from
interfering with each other.
