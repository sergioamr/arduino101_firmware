DESCRIPTION
A command packet is an opaque data structure that maps to a k_args without
exposing its innards. It allows a subsystem, like a driver, that needs its
fibers or ISRs to communicate with tasks to define a set of such packets to
be passed to the isr_xxx routines, such as isr_sem_give(), that, in turn,
needs to obtain command packets to interact with the microkernel.

Each command packet set is created in global memory using ...
    CMD_PKT_SET_INSTANCE(set variable name, # of command packets in the set);

Once created, the command packet set is accessed using ...
    CMD_PKT_SET(set variable name).<member field name>

A command packet set is a simple ring buffer.  No error checking is performed
when a command packet is retrieved from the set.  Each obtained command packet
is implicitly released once the command packet has been processed.  Thus, it is
important that each command packet be processed in a near-FIFO order to prevent
corruption of command packets that are already in use.  To this end, drivers
that have an ISR component should use their own command packet set.
