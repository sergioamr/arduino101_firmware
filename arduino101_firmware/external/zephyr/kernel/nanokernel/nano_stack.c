DESCRIPTION
This module provides the nanokernel stack object implementation, including
the following APIs:

   nano_stack_init
   nano_fiber_stack_push, nano_task_stack_push, nano_isr_stack_push
   nano_fiber_stack_pop, nano_task_stack_pop, nano_isr_stack_pop
   nano_fiber_stack_pop_wait, nano_task_stack_pop_wait


INTERNAL
In some cases the compiler "alias" attribute is used to map two or more
APIs to the same function, since they have identical implementations.
