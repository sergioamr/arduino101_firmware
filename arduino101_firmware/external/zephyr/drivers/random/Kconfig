config  RANDOM_GENERATOR
        bool
	prompt "Custom random generator"
        default n
        help
          This option signifies that the target uses a real random number
	  generator.

config  TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	bool
	prompt "Non-random number generator"
	depends on !RANDOM_GENERATOR
	default n
	help
	  This option signifies that the kernel's random number APIs are
	  permitted to return values that are not truly random.
	  This capability is provided for testing purposes, when a truly random
	  number generator is not available. The non-random number generator
	  should not be used in a production environment.

config  X86_TSC_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	bool
	prompt "x86 timestamp counter based number generator"
	depends on TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR && X86_32
	default y
	help
	  This options enables number generator based on timestamp counter
	  of x86 platform, obtained with rdtsc instruction.

config  TIMER_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	bool
	prompt "System timer clock based number generator"
	depends on TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR && !X86_TSC_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	default y
	help
	  This options enables number generator based on system timer
	  clock. This number generator is not random and used for
	  testing only.
