DESCRIPTION
This module implements a kernel device driver for the Intel local APIC
device, and provides the standard "system clock driver" interfaces.
This library contains routines for the timer in the Intel local APIC/xAPIC
(Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) in P6 (PentiumPro, II, III)
and P7 (Pentium4) family processor.
The local APIC contains a 32-bit programmable timer for use by the local
processor.  The time base is derived from the processor's bus clock,
divided by a value specified in the divide configuration register.
After reset, the timer is initialized to zero.
