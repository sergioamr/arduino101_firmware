DESCRIPTION
This module implements a kernel device driver for the Intel High Precision
Event Timer (HPET) device, and provides the standard "system clock driver"
interfaces.

The driver utilizes HPET timer0 to provide kernel ticks.

\INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
The HPET device driver makes no assumption about the initial state of the HPET,
and explicitly puts the device into a reset-like state. It also assumes that
the main up counter never wraps around to 0 during the lifetime of the system.

The BSP can configure the HPET to use level rather than the default edge
sensitive interrupts by adding the following to board.h
    #define HPET_USE_LEVEL_INTS

When not configured to support tickless idle timer0 is programmed in periodic
mode so it automatically generates a single interrupt per kernel tick interval.

When configured to support tickless idle timer0 is programmed in one-shot mode.
When the CPU is not idling the timer interrupt handler sets the timer to expire
when the next kernel tick is due, waits for this to occur, and then repeats
this "ad infinitum". When the CPU begins idling the timer driver reprograms
the expiry time for the timer (thereby overriding the previously scheduled
timer interrupt) and waits for the timer to expire or for a non-timer interrupt
to occur. When the CPU ceases idling the driver determines how many complete
ticks have elapsed, reprograms the timer so that it expires on the next tick,
and announces the number of elapsed ticks (if any) to the microkernel.

In a nanokernel-only system this device driver omits more complex capabilities
(such as tickless idle support) that are only used with a microkernel.
