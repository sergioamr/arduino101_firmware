DESCRIPTION
This module implements a kernel device driver for the Intel 8253 PIT
(Programmable Interval Timer) device, and provides the standard "system
clock driver" interfaces.

Channel 0 is programmed to operate in "Interrupt on Terminal Count" mode,
with the interrupt rate determined by the 'sys_clock_us_per_tick'
global variable.
Changing the interrupt rate at runtime is not supported.

Generally, this module is not utilized in Wind River Hypervisor systems;
instead the Hypervisor tick timer service is utilized to deliver system clock
ticks into the guest operating system.  However, this driver has been modified
to access the PIT in scenarios where the PIT registers are mapped into a guest.
An interrupt controller driver will not be utilized, so this driver will
directly invoke the VIOAPIC APIs to configure/unmask the IRQ.
