/**
 *
 * @brief Allocate interrupt vector
 *
 * This BSP provided routine supports the irq_connect() API.  This
 * routine is required to perform the following 3 functions:
 *
 *  a) Allocate a vector satisfying the requested priority.  The utility routine
 *     _IntVecAlloc() provided by the nanokernel will be used to perform the
 *     the allocation since the local APIC prioritizes interrupts as assumed
 *     by _IntVecAlloc().
 *  b) Return End of Interrupt (EOI) and Beginning of Interrupt (BOI) related
 *     information to be used when generating the interrupt stub code, and
 *  c) If an interrupt vector can be allocated, and the <irq> argument is not
 *     equal to NANO_SOFT_IRQ, the IOAPIC redirection table (RED) or the
 *     LOAPIC local vector table (LVT) will be updated with the allocated
 *     interrupt vector.
 *
 * The board virtualizes IRQs as follows:
 *
 * - The first IOAPIC_NUM_RTES IRQs are provided by the IOAPIC
 * - The remaining IRQs are provided by the LOAPIC.
 *
 * Thus, for example, if the IOAPIC supports 24 IRQs:
 *
 * - IRQ0 to IRQ23   map to IOAPIC IRQ0 to IRQ23
 * - IRQ24 to IRQ29  map to LOAPIC LVT entries as follows:
 *
 *       IRQ24 -> LOAPIC_TIMER
 *       IRQ25 -> LOAPIC_THERMAL
 *       IRQ26 -> LOAPIC_PMC
 *       IRQ27 -> LOAPIC_LINT0
 *       IRQ28 -> LOAPIC_LINT1
 *       IRQ29 -> LOAPIC_ERROR
 *
 * The IOAPIC_NUM_RTES macro is provided by board.h, and it specifies the number
 * of IRQs supported by the on-board I/O APIC device.
 *
 * @return the allocated interrupt vector
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * For debug kernels, this routine will return -1 if there are no vectors
 * remaining in the specified <priority> level, or if the <priority> or <irq>
 * parameters are invalid.
