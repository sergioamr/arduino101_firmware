DESCRIPTION
This module implements a kernel device driver for the Intel 8259A PIC
(Programmable Interrupt Controller).  In summary, the i8259A supports
up to 8 vectored priority interrupts.  Cascading up to 8 PICs allows support
of up to 64 vectored priority interrupts.  This device driver assumes two
cascaded 8259A (which is the standard configuration for desktop PC platforms).

This driver initializes the PICs to operate in fully nested mode, and
issues non-specified EOI mode (an exported routine that must be invoked
just prior to an ISR returning).

The following is an description of "Fully Nested Mode":
In this mode, interrupt requests are ordered in priority from 0 through 7
(0 is the highest priority).  When an interrupt is acknowledged, the highest
priority request is determined and its vector is placed on the bus.
Additionally, a bit of the Interrupt Service (IS) register is set.  This bit
remains set until the microprocessor issues an EOI command immediately before
returning from the interrupt service routine (ISR).  While the IS bit is set,
all further interrupts of the same or lower priority are inhibited, while
higher level interrupts are allowed.  The _i8259_eoi() routine is used by
the ISR to issue an EOI command.  The PICs in a PC typically operate
in this mode.  In this mode, while the slave PIC is being serviced by the
master PIC, the slave PIC blocks all higher priority interrupt requests.

Non-Specific EOI: When the 8259A is operated in the Fully Nested Mode, it
can determine which IS bit to reset on EOI.  When a non-specific EOI
command is issued, the 8259A will automatically reset the highest IS bit of
those that are set, since in the fully nested mode the highest IS level is
the last level acknowledged and serviced.
