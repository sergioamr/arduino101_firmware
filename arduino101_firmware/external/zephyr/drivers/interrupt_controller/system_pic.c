/**
 *
 * @brief Allocate interrupt vector
 *
 * This BSP provided routine supports the irq_connect() API.  This
 * routine performs the following functions:
 *
 *  a) Allocates a vector satisfying the requested priority, where possible.
 *     When the <irq> argument is not equal to NANO_SOFT_IRQ, the vector assigned
 *     to the <irq> during interrupt controller initialization is returned,
 *     which may or may not have the desired prioritization. (Prioritization of
 *     such vectors is fixed by the 8259 interrupt controllers, and cannot be
 *     programmed on an IRQ basis; for example, IRQ0 is always the highest
 *     priority interrupt no matter which interrupt vector was assigned to IRQ0.)
 *  b) Provides End of Interrupt (EOI) and Beginning of Interrupt (BOI) related
 *     information to be used when generating the interrupt stub code.
 *
 * The pcPentium4 board virtualizes IRQs as follows:
 *
 *  - IRQ0 to IRQ7  are provided by the master i8259 PIC
 *  - IRQ8 to IRQ15 are provided by the slave i8259 PIC
 *
 * @return the allocated interrupt vector
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * For debug kernels, this routine will return -1 for invalid <priority> or
 * <irq> parameter values.
