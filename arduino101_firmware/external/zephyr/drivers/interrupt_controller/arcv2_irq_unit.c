/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 * The ARCv2 interrupt unit has 16 allocated exceptions associated with
 * vectors 0 to 15 and 240 interrupts associated with vectors 16 to 255.
 * The interrupt unit is optional in the ARCv2-based processors. When
 * building a processor, you can configure the processor to include an
 * interrupt unit. The ARCv2 interrupt unit is highly programmable.

 * selected IRQ's registers.
