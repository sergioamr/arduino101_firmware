 * @brief Create an IDT entry
 *
 * This routine creates an interrupt-gate descriptor at the location defined by
 * <pIdtEntry>. The entry is created such that <routine> is invoked when an
 * interrupt vector is asserted.  The <dpl> argument specifies the privilege
 * level for the interrupt-gate descriptor; (hardware) interrupts and exceptions
 * should specify a level of 0, whereas handlers for user-mode software generated
 * interrupts should specify 3.
 *
 * @return N/A
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * This is a shared routine between the IA-32 nanokernel runtime code and the
 * genIdt host tool code. It is done this way to keep the two sides in sync.
 *
 * The runtime passes a pointer directly to the IDT entry to update whereas the
 * host side simply passes a pointer to a local variable.
