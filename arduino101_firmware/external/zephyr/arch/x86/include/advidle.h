DESCRIPTION
This header file specifies the custom advanced idle management interface.
All of the APIs declared here must be supplied by the custom advanced idle
management system, namely the _AdvIdleCheckSleep(), _AdvIdleFunc()
and _AdvIdleStart() functions.

 * @brief Determine if advanced sleep has occurred

 * @brief Continue kernel start-up or awaken kernel from sleep

 * This routine checks if the system is recovering from advanced sleep and

 * kernel operation at the point it went to sleep; in the latter case, control
 * passes to the _AdvIdleFunc() that put the system to sleep, which then
 * finishes executing.

 * @brief Perform advanced sleep

 * justify entering advanced sleep mode. If it is, the routine puts the system
 * to sleep and then later allows it to resume processing; if not, the routine
 * returns immediately without sleeping.
