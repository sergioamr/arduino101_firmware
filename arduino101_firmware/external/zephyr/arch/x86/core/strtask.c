	 * The IA-32 nanokernel implementation uses the USE_FP bit in the
	 * tCCS->flags structure as a "dirty bit".  The USE_FP flag bit will be
	 * set whenever a context uses any non-integer capability, whether it's
	 * just the x87 FPU capability, SSE instructions, or a combination of
	 * both. The USE_SSE flag bit will only be set if a context uses SSE
	 * instructions.
	 *
	 * However, callers of fiber_fiber_start(), task_fiber_start(), or even
	 * _NewContext() don't need to follow the protocol used by the IA-32
	 * nanokernel w.r.t. managing the tCCS->flags field.  If a context
	 * will be utilizing just the x87 FPU capability, then the USE_FP
	 * option bit is specified.  If a context will be utilizing SSE
	 * instructions (and possibly x87 FPU capability), then only the
	 * USE_SSE option bit needs to be specified.
	 *
	 * Likewise, the placement of tasks into "groups" doesn't need to follow
	 * the protocol used by the IA-32 nanokernel w.r.t. managing the
	 * tCCS->flags field.  If a task will utilize just the x87 FPU
	 *capability,
	 * then the task only needs to be placed in the FPU_GROUP group.
	 * If a task utilizes SSE instructions (and possibly x87 FPU
	 *capability),
	 * then the task only needs to be placed in the SSE_GROUP group.
