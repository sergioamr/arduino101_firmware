 * The first time the new context is scheduled by _Swap() it is guaranteed
 * to inherit an FPU that is in a "sane" state (if the most recent user of
 * the FPU was cooperatively swapped out) or a completely "clean" state
 * (if the most recent user of the FPU was pre-empted, or if the new context
 * is the first user of the FPU).
 *
 * The USE_FP flag bit is set in the tCCS structure if a context is
 * authorized to use _any_ non-integer capability, whether it's the basic
 * x87 FPU/MMX capability, SSE instructions, or a combination of both. The
 * USE_SSE flag bit is set only if a context can use SSE instructions.
 *
 * Note: Callers need not follow the aforementioned protocol when passing
 * in context options. It is legal for the caller to specify _only_ the
 * USE_SSE option bit if a context will be utilizing SSE instructions (and
 * possibly x87 FPU/MMX instructions).

/*
 * Implementation Remark:
 * Until SysGen reserves SSE_GROUP as 0x10, the following conditional is
 * required so that at least systems configured with FLOAT will still operate
 * correctly.  The issue is that SysGen will utilize group 0x10 user-defined
 * groups, and thus tasks placed in the user-defined group will have the
 * SSE_GROUP (but not the FPU_GROUP) bit set.  This results in both the USE_FP
 * and USE_SSE bits being set in the tCCS.  For systems configured only with
 * FLOAT, the setting of the USE_SSE is harmless, but the setting of USE_FP is
 * wasteful.  Thus to ensure that that systems configured only with FLOAT
 * behave as expected, the USE_SSE option bit is ignored.
 *
 * Clearly, even with the following conditional, systems configured with
 * SSE will not behave as expected since tasks may still be inadvertantly
 * have the USE_SSE+USE_FP sets even though they are integer only.
 *
 * Once the generator tool has been updated to reserve the SSE_GROUP, the
 * correct code to use is:
 *
 *    options &= USE_FP | USE_SSE;
 *

/**
 *
 * @brief Adjust stack before invoking _context_entry
 *
 * This function adjusts the initial stack frame created by _NewContext()
 * such that the GDB stack frame unwinders recognize it as the outermost frame
 * in the context's stack.  The function then jumps to _context_entry().
 *
 * GDB normally stops unwinding a stack when it detects that it has
 * reached a function called main().  Kernel tasks, however, do not have
 * a main() function, and there does not appear to be a simple way of stopping
 * the unwinding of the stack.
 *
 * Given the initial context created by _NewContext(), GDB expects to find a
 * return address on the stack immediately above the context entry routine
 * _context_entry, in the location occupied by the initial EFLAGS.
 * GDB attempts to examine the memory at this return address, which typically
 * results in an invalid access to page 0 of memory.
 *
 * This function overwrites the initial EFLAGS with zero.  When GDB subsequently
 * attempts to examine memory at address zero, the PeekPoke driver detects
 * an invalid access to address zero and returns an error, which causes the
 * GDB stack unwinder to stop somewhat gracefully.
