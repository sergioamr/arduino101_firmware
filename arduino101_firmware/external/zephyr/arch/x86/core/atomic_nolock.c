DESCRIPTION
This module provides the atomic operators for IA-32 architectures on BSPs
that do not support the LOCK prefix instruction.

The atomic operations are guaranteed to be atomic with respect to interrupt
service routines. However, they are NOT guaranteed to be atomic with respect
to operations performed by peer processors, unlike the versions of these
operators that do utilize the LOCK prefix instruction.

INTERNAL
These operators are currently unavailable to user space applications
as there is no requirement for this capability.

 * @brief Atomic compare-and-set primitive

 * This routine provides the compare-and-set operator. If the original value at

 * function returns 1.
 *
 * If the original value at <target> does not equal <oldValue>, then the store
 * is not done and the function returns 0.
 *
 * The reading of the original value at <target>, the comparison,
 * and the write of the new value (if it occurs) all happen atomically with
 * respect to both interrupts and accesses of other processors to <target>.
 *
 * @return Returns 1 if <newValue> is written, 0 otherwise.
