DESCRIPTION
This module provides routines to manage exceptions (synchronous interrupts)
on the IA-32 architecture.

This module provides the public routine nanoCpuExcConnect().

INTERNAL
An exception is defined as a synchronous interrupt, i.e. an interrupt
asserted as a direct result of program execution as opposed to a
hardware device asserting an interrupt.

Many (but not all) exceptions are handled by an "exception stub" whose code
is generated by the system itself.  The stub performs various actions before
and after invoking the application (or operating system) specific exception
handler; for example, a thread or ISR context save is performed prior to
invoking the exception handler.

The IA-32 code that makes up a "full" exception stub is shown below.  A full
exception stub is one that pushes a dummy error code at the start of
exception processing.  Exception types where the processor automatically
pushes an error code when handling an exception utilize similar exception
stubs, however the first instruction is omitted.  The use of the dummy error
code means that _ExcEnt() and _ExcExit() do not have to worry about whether
an error code is present on the stack or not.


  0x00   pushl   $0			/@ push dummy error code @/
  Machine code:  0x68, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00

  0x05   call    _ExcEnt		/@ inform kernel of exception @/
  Machine code:  0xe8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00

  0x0a   call    ExcHandler		/@ invoke exception handler @/
  Machine code: 0xe8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00

  /@ _ExcExit() will adjust the stack to discard the error code @/

  0x0f  jmp	   _ExcExit		/@ restore context context @/
  Machine code: 0xe9, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00

NOTE: Be sure to update the arch specific definition of the _EXC_STUB_SIZE
macro to reflect the size of the full exception stub (as shown above).
The _EXC_STUB_SIZE macro is defined in arch/x86/include/nano_private.h.
