DESCRIPTION
This module allows multiple tasks and fibers to safely share the system's
floating point resources, by allowing the system to save FPU state information
in a task or fiber's stack region when a pre-emptive context switch occurs.

The floating point resource sharing mechanism is designed for minimal
intrusiveness.  Floating point context saving is only performed for tasks and
fibers that explicitly enable FP resource sharing, to avoid impacting the stack
size requirements of all other tasks and fibers.  For those tasks and fibers
that do require FP resource sharing, a "lazy save/restore" mechanism is employed
so that the FPU's register sets are only switched in and out when absolutely
necessary; this avoids wasting effort preserving them when there is no risk
that they will be altered, or when there is no need to preserve their contents.

The following APIs are provided to allow floating point resource sharing to be
enabled or disabled at run-time:

	void fiber_float_enable  (nano_context_id_t ctxId, unsigned int options)
	void task_float_enable   (nano_context_id_t ctxId, unsigned int options)
	void fiber_float_disable (nano_context_id_t ctxId)
	void task_float_disable  (nano_context_id_t ctxId)

The 'options' parameter is used to specify what non-integer capabilities are
being used.  The same options accepted by fiber_fiber_start() are used in the
aforementioned APIs, namely USE_FP and USE_SSE.

If the nanokernel has been built with support for automatic enabling
of floating point resource sharing (CONFIG_AUTOMATIC_FP_ENABLING) the
system automatically enables sharing for any non-enabled task or fiber as soon
as it begins using floating point instructions.  (Note: The task or fiber must
have enough room available on its stack to allow floating point state info
to be saved, otherwise stack corruption will occur.)

If the nanokernel has been built without SSE instruction support
(CONFIG_SSE), the system treats USE_SSE as if it was USE_FP.

If the nanokernel has been built without floating point resource
sharing support (CONFIG_FP_SHARING), the aforementioned APIs and
capabilities do not exist.

NOTE
It is possible for a single task or fiber to utilize floating instructions
_without_ enabling the FP resource sharing feature.  Since no other task or
fiber uses the FPU the FP registers won't change when the FP-capable task or
fiber isn't executing, meaning there is no need to save the registers.

WARNING
The use of floating point instructions by ISRs is not supported by the kernel.

INTERNAL
If automatic enabling of floating point resource sharing _is not_ configured
the system leaves CR0[TS] = 0 for all tasks and fibers.  This means that any
task or fiber can perform floating point operations at any time without causing
an exception, and the system won't stop a task or fiber that shouldn't be
doing FP stuff from doing it.

If automatic enabling of floating point resource sharing _is_ configured the
system leaves CR0[TS] = 0 only for tasks and fibers that are allowed to perform
FP operations.  All other tasks and fibers have CR0[TS] = 1 so that an attempt
to perform an FP operation will cause an exception, allowing the system to
enable FP resource sharing on its behalf.

 *  b) USE_SSE indicates x87 FPU and MMX and SSEx registers

 * Invoking this routine creates a floating point context for the task/fiber
 * that corresponds to an FPU that has been reset.  The system will thereafter
 * protect the task/fiber's FP context so that it is not altered during

 * (since context switching can't occur), but it is harmless and allows a single

 *
 * If necessary, the interrupt latency impact of calling this routine from a
 * fiber could be lessened by re-designing things so that only task-type callers
 * locked interrupts (i.e. move the locking to task_float_enable()). However,
