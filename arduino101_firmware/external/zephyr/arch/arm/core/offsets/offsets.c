DESCRIPTION
This module is responsible for the generation of the absolute symbols whose
value represents the member offsets for various ARM nanokernel
structures.

All of the absolute symbols defined by this module will be present in the
final microkernel or nanokernel ELF image (due to the linker's reference to
the _OffsetAbsSyms symbol).

INTERNAL
It is NOT necessary to define the offset for every member of a structure.
Typically, only those members that are accessed by assembly language routines
are defined; however, it doesn't hurt to define all fields for the sake of
completeness.
