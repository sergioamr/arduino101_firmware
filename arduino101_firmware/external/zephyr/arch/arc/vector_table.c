DESCRIPTION
Vector table with exceptions filled in. The reset vector is the system entry
point, ie. the first instruction executed.

The table is populated with all the system exception handlers. No exception
should not be triggered until the kernel is ready to handle them.

We are using a C file instead of an assembly file (like the ARM vector table)
to work around an issue with the assembler where:

  .word <function>

statements would end up with the two half-words of the functions' addresses
swapped.
