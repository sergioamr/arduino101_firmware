 *
 * @brief Fatal error handler
 *
 * This routine implements the corrective action to be taken when the system
 * detects a fatal error.
 *
 * This sample implementation attempts to abort the current context and allow
 * the system to continue executing, which may permit the system to continue
 * functioning with degraded capabilities.
 *
 * System designers may wish to enhance or substitute this sample
 * implementation to take other actions, such as logging error (or debug)
 * information to a persistent repository and/or rebooting the system.
