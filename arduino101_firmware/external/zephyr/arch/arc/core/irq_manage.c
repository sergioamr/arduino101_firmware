 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Interrupt management:
 *
 * - enabling/disabling
 * - dynamic ISR connecting/replacing
 *
 * SW_ISR_TABLE_DYNAMIC has to be enabled for connecting ISRs at runtime.
 *
 * An IRQ number passed to the <irq> parameters found in this file is a
 * number from 16 to last IRQ number on the platform.
