/**
 *
 * @brief Disable all interrupts on the local CPU
 *
 * This routine disables interrupts.  It can be called from either interrupt,
 * task or fiber level.  This routine returns an architecture-dependent
 * lock-out key representing the "interrupt disable state" prior to the call;
 * this key can be passed to irq_unlock() to re-enable interrupts.
 *
 * The lock-out key should only be used as the argument to the
 * irq_unlock() API.  It should never be used to manually re-enable
 * interrupts or to inspect or manipulate the contents of the source register.
 *
 * WARNINGS
 * Invoking a kernel routine with interrupts locked may result in
 * interrupts being re-enabled for an unspecified period of time.  If the
 * called routine blocks, interrupts will be re-enabled while another
 * context executes, or while the system is idle.
 *
 * The "interrupt disable state" is an attribute of a context.  Thus, if a
 * fiber or task disables interrupts and subsequently invokes a kernel
 * routine that causes the calling context to block, the interrupt
 * disable state will be restored when the context is later rescheduled
 * for execution.
 *
 * @return An architecture-dependent lock-out key representing the
 * "interrupt disable state" prior to the call.
