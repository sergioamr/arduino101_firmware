 *
 * This routine is called when fatal error conditions are detected by software
 * and is responsible only for reporting the error. Once reported, it then
 * invokes the user provided routine _SysFatalErrorHandler() which is
 * responsible for implementing the error handling policy.
 *
 * The caller is expected to always provide a usable ESF. In the event that the
 * fatal error does not have a hardware generated ESF, the caller should either
 * create its own or use a pointer to the global default ESF <_default_esf>.
 *
 * @return This function does not return.
