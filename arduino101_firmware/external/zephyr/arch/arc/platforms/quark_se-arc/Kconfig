        This option holds the directory name used by sysgen to identify
        the location of the config1p.vpf file and is used by the build system
        to locate the correct linker file.

	  For running on nSIM simulator.

	  a) Uses non-XIP to run in RAM.
	  b) Linked at address 0x4000 with 0x4000 of RAM so that it works with
	     a pc_size of 16 (default).
	  c) Sets the entry point to __reset, since it seems nSIM ignores the
	     reset vector when starting (??).
