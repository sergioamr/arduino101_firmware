config	ARC
	bool
	default y
	help
	  This option signifies the use of an ARC system.

config PLATFORM_QUARK_SE_ARC
	bool "Minimum configuration for Quark_SE"
	default y


menu "ARC EM4 processor options"

config	CPU_ARCEM4
	bool
	default y
	select CPU_ARCV2
	help
         This option signifies the use of an ARC EM4 CPU

endmenu

menu "ARCv2 Family Options"

config	CPU_ARCV2
	bool
	default y
	select ARC
	help
	  This option signifies the use of a CPU of the ARCv2 family.

config	DATA_ENDIANNESS_LITTLE
	bool
	default y
	help
	  This is driven by the processor implementation, since it is fixed in
	  hardware. The BSP should set this value to 'n' if the data is
	  implemented as big endian.

config	NUM_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS
	int
	prompt "Number of supported interrupt priority levels"
	default 1
	range 1 16
	help
	  Interrupt priorities available will be 0 to NUM_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS-1.
	  The minimum value is 1.

	  The BSP must provide a valid default for proper operation.

config	NUM_REGULAR_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS
	int
	prompt "Number of supported regular interrupt priority levels"
	default 1
	range 1 16
	help
	 This represents the number of Regular Interrupt priorities, which
	 does NOT include the Fast (FIRQ) priority.
	 The Regular Interrupt priorities available will be
	  (NUM_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS - NUM_REGULAR_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS) to
	  (NUM_REGULAR_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS - 1).

	  The maximum value is NUM_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS.

	  The BSP must provide a valid default for proper operation.

config	NUM_IRQS
	int
	prompt "Upper limit of interrupt numbers/IDs used"
	default 17
	range 1 256
	help
	  Interrupts available will be 0 to NUM_IRQS-1.
	  The minimum value is 1.

	  The BSP must provide a valid default. This drives the size of the
	  vector table.

config	FIRQ_STACK_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Size of stack for FIRQs (in bytes)"
	depends on CPU_ARCV2
	default 1024
	help
	  FIRQs and regular IRQs have different stacks so that a FIRQ can start
	  running without doing stack switching in software.

config	STACK_CHECKING
	bool
	prompt "ARC CPU stack checking is enabled/disabled."
	depends on ENHANCED_SECURITY
	default y
	help
	  Enable or disable CPU stack checking.

config	FAULT_DUMP
	int
	prompt "Fault dump level"
	default 2
	help
	  Different levels for display information when a fault occurs.

	  2: The default. Display specific and verbose information. Consumes
	     the most memory (long strings).
	  1: Display general and short information. Consumes less memory
	     (short strings).
	  0: Off.

config	XIP
	default n if NSIM
	default y

config  SW_ISR_TABLE
	bool
	prompt "Enable software interrupt handler table"
	default y
	help
	  Enable an interrupt handler table implemented in software. This
	  table, unlike ISRs connected directly in the vector table, allow
	  a parameter to be passed to the interrupt handlers. Also, invoking
	  the exeception/interrupt exit stub is automatically done.

	  This has to be enabled for dynamically connecting interrupt handlers
	  at runtime (SW_ISR_TABLE_DYNAMIC).

config  SW_ISR_TABLE_DYNAMIC
	bool
	prompt "Allow installing interrupt handlers at runtime"
	depends on SW_ISR_TABLE
	default y
	help
	  This option enables nanoCpuIntConnect(). It moves the ISR table to
	  SRAM so that it is writable. This has the side-effect of removing
	  write-protection on the ISR table.

config  SW_ISR_TABLE_STATIC_CUSTOM
	bool
	prompt "Projects provide a custom static software ISR table"
	depends on SW_ISR_TABLE && !SW_ISR_TABLE_DYNAMIC
	default n
	help
	  Projects, not the BSP, provide a software table of ISR and their
	  parameters. The table is static, and thus ISRs cannot be connected
	  at runtime.

config	SW_ISR_TABLE_BSP
	bool
	# omit prompt to signify a "hidden" option
	depends on SW_ISR_TABLE_DYNAMIC || (SW_ISR_TABLE && !SW_ISR_TABLE_STATIC_CUSTOM)
	default y
	help
	  Not user-selectable, helps build system logic.

config  IRQ_VECTOR_TABLE_CUSTOM
	bool
	prompt "Projects provide a custom static IRQ part of vector table"
	depends on !SW_ISR_TABLE
	default n
	help
	  Projects, not the BSP, provide the IRQ part of the vector table.

	  This is the table of interrupt handlers with the best potential
	  performance, but is the less flexible.

	  The ISRs are installed directly in the vector table, thus are
	  directly called by the CPU when an interrupt is taken. This adds
	  the least overhead when handling an interrupt.

	  Downsides:
	  - ISRs cannot have a parameter
	  - ISRs cannot be connected at runtime
	  - ISRs must notify the kernel manually by invoking _ExcExit() when
		then are about to return.

config	IRQ_VECTOR_TABLE_BSP
	bool
	# omit prompt to signify a "hidden" option
	depends on SW_ISR_TABLE || !IRQ_VECTOR_TABLE_CUSTOM
	default y
	help
	  Not user-selectable, helps build system logic.

config  ARCH_HAS_TASK_ABORT
	bool
	# omit prompt to signify a "hidden" option
	default n

config  ARCH_HAS_NANO_FIBER_ABORT
	bool
	# omit prompt to signify a "hidden" option
	default n
