Script to regression test kernel operation.

The sanity check builds all sample projects supported by the specified platform;
if no platform has been specified, a default platform for each project is used.
The script also runs each sample project using QEMU, where possible; if desired
the script can be instructed to skip the QEMU execution step.

The script returns 0 on success. If an error is encountered at any point
the script returns the exit value of the command that failed, the function
and line of the script where the error was detected, as well as the full path
of the script (to help debug path issues).

*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=

QEMU output from a project is sent to a log file identified by the script;
it is typically located in the associated sample project directory.
You can monitor execution by doing 'tail -f <log filename>' in another shell.

A project's log file is normally retained only if execution fails; however,
invoking the script with the '-l' option keeps the log file in all cases.

*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=*-=

All object code and executable files persist after completion. Re-run the script
with the '-c' option to delete the sample project object code and log files.
