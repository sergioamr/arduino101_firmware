config	NETWORKING
	bool
	prompt "Generic networkig support [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	help
	  This option enabled generic networking support.

choice
prompt "Internet Protocol version"
depends on NETWORKING
help
	The IP stack can either support IPv6 or IPv4 but
	not both at the same time. The IPv6 support should
	be selected by default as there is limited set of
	network bearers provided that support IPv4.
default NETWORKING_WITH_IPV6
config NETWORKING_WITH_IPV6
	bool "IPv6"
	help
	  Choose this if unsure.
config NETWORKING_WITH_IPV4
	bool "IPv4"
	help
	  Legacy IP.
endchoice

config	NETWORKING_WITH_RPL
	bool
	prompt "Enable RPL (ripple) IPv6 mesh routing protocol"
	depends on NETWORKING && NETWORKING_WITH_IPV6
	default n
	help
	  Enable RPL (RFC 6550) IPv6 Routing Protocol for
	  Low-Power and Lossy Networks.

config	NETWORKING_WITH_LOGGING
	bool
	prompt "Enable logging of the uIP stack"
	depends on NETWORKING
	default n
	help
	  Enable packet and uIP stack logging

config	NETWORKING_WITH_LOOPBACK
	bool
	prompt "Enable loopback driver"
	depends on NETWORKING
	default n
	help
	  Enable a simple loopback driver that installs
	  IPv6 loopback addresses into routing table and
	  neighbor cache. All packets transmitted are
	  looped back to the receiving fifo/fiber.

config	NETWORKING_UART
	bool
	prompt "Network UART/slip driver"
	depends on NETWORKING
	select UART_SIMPLE
	default n
	help
	  Enable UART driver for passing IPv6 packets using slip.
	  This requires running tunslip6 tool in host. See README
	  file at net/ip/contiki/tools directory for details.

config	NETWORKING_DEBUG_UART
	bool
	prompt "Network UART driver debug"
	depends on NETWORKING_UART && NETWORKING_WITH_LOGGING
	default n
	help
	  This option enables debug support for network UART
	  driver.

config	NETWORKING_WITH_15_4
	bool
	prompt "Enable 802.15.4 driver"
	depends on NETWORKING && NETWORKING_WITH_IPV6
	default n
	help
	  Enable 802.15.4 driver that receives the IPv6 packet,
	  does header compression on it and writes it to the
	  802.15.4 stack Tx FIFO. The 802.15.4 Tx fiber will pick up
	  the header compressed IPv6 6lowpan packet and fragment
	  it into suitable chunks ready to be sent to the 802.15.4
	  hw driver

default n
help
       The 802.15.4 layer can either support loopback within
       or loopback with uart but not both at the same time.
config	NETWORKING_WITH_15_4_LOOPBACK
	bool
	prompt "Enable 802.15.4 loopback radio driver"
	help
	  Enable 802.15.4 loopback radio driver that receives
	  the 802.15.4 frame and put it back 802.15.4 Rx Fifo.

config NETWORKING_WITH_15_4_LOOPBACK_UART
       bool
       prompt "Enable 802.15.4 loopback radio uart driver"
       select UART_SIMPLE
       help
         Enable 802.15.4 loopback radio driver that sends
         802.15.4 frames out of qemu through uart and receive
         frames through uart. This way one can test 802.15.4 frames
         between two qemus
