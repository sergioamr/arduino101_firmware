Zephyr Kernel Objects
######################

Use this information to understand how the different kernel objects of
the Zephyr Kernel function. The purpose of this section is to help you
understand the most important object of the operating system. In order
to help you navigate through the content, we have divided the objects
in :ref:`basicObjects`, :ref:`nanokernelObjects` and
:ref:`microkernelObjects` objects.

We strongly recommend that you start with the :ref:`basicObjects` before
moving on to the :ref:`nanokernelObjects` or the
:ref:`microkernelObjects`. Additionally, we have included some
:ref:`driverExamples` for better comprehension of the objects' function.
