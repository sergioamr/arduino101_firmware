Execution Contexts
##################

Tasks, fibers and interrupt service routines serve as the basis of the
operating system functionality. The purpose of this section is to
describe how this execution contexts operate, their behavior and their
implementation. Using this information you should be able to understand
what each context is capable of, how it operates and where its limits
are.

This section does not replace the Application Program Interface
documentation but rather complements it. The examples should provide
you with enough insight to understand the functionality but are not
meant to replace the detailed in-code documentation.
