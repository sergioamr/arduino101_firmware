Parallelism
###########
Parallelism refers to the practice of using similar patterns of
grammatical structure, and sometimes length, for coordinated words,
phrases, and clauses.

Parallel construction is especially important in bulleted lists. The
table shows some unparallel structures and how they can be made
parallel with a little rewording.
