Restructured Text Guidelines
############################

The |project| uses Sphinx and Restructured Text as authoring tools for
documentation. Here you can find the preferred methods for using :abbr
:`ReST (Restructured Text)` markup on your documents. Please refer to
the `Sphinx documentation`_ for the complete list of available markup.

Templates, examples and usage scenarios are provided to help you write
and edit documents easily. Use only the templates provided to ensure
that your content is consistent with the documentation. The use of the
correct markup is mandatory to consider a submission fit to be merged.

In order to allow for easy copy and paste of the provided templates,
they are provided using either the "\`\`" parenthesis, for single line
templates, or the code-block directive, for multi-lined templates.

Every use case is explained, then examples are provided and, lastly,
templates are supplied.
