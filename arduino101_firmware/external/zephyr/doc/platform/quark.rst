.. _Intel® Quark Software Developer Manual for Linux: http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/quark-x1000-linux-sw-developers-manual.pdf


PCI
===

The PCI driver initiates a PCI library scan of the PCI bus for any attached devices.
If devices are detected, they are initialized. 

.. note::

  The PCI library does not support 64 bit devices. Memory
  address and size storage only require 32 bit integers.


Serial Port Polling Mode Support
================================

The polling mode serial port allows debug output to be printed.

For more information, see Intel® Quark SoC X1000 Datasheet, section `18.3.3 FIFO Polled-Mode Operation`_

.. _18.3.3 FIFO Polled-Mode Operation: https://communities.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/21828-102-2-25120/329676_QuarkDatasheet.pdf


Serial Port Interrupt Mode Support
==================================

The interrupt mode serial port is used to provide general serial communication
and external communication.

For more information, see Intel® Quark SoC X1000 Datasheet, section `21.12.1.4.5 Poll Mode`_

.. _21.12.1.4.5 Poll Mode: https://communities.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/21828-102-2-25120/329676_QuarkDatasheet.pdf


Interrupts
----------

The quark platform configuration uses the Zephyr project static
:abbr:`Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)` to program the
:abbr: Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC)`
interrupt redirection table. 


+-------+-----------+------------------+-------------------------------+
|IRQ	| Name	    | Used by Zephyr   | Remarks                       |
+=======+===========+==================+===============================+
|17	| INTB	    |   UART           | serial port in interrupt mode |
+-------+-----------+------------------+-------------------------------+
|20	| timer     |   HPET           | timer driver                  |
+-------+-----------+------------------+-------------------------------+


.. note::

   The quark platform configuration does not support
   interrupt sharing, for example, two PCI devices can not use same IRQ.


Configuration Options
---------------------

:option:`CONFIG_PCI_DEBUG`
      Set to "y" to enable PCI debugging functions for PCI bus scanning.
      Allows a list of all the PCI devices found to be printed.


HPET System Clock Support
=========================

Quark uses HPET timing with legacy-free timer support. The quark platform 
configuration uses HPET as a system clock timer.



------------
 PROCEDURES
------------


Use the following procedures for booting a project on
a Galileo board.

* `Creating a GRUB2 Boot Loader Image from a Linux Host`_

* `Preparing the Boot Device`_

* `Booting the Galileo Board`_


Creating a GRUB2 Boot Loader Image from a Linux Host
====================================================

Create a GRUB2 boot loader image needed later to load
a project image on to a Galileo board.


Prerequisite
------------

* The Linux host computer is running Ubuntu 12.04.

* The GNU EFI development libraries (version 3.0u) is installed.

* The GRUB 2.0 source code is available.

  .. note:
     Only the specified release of the GRUB2 tarball works with the
     quark platform configuration.

* The Zephyr project image is available in the project directory.

Steps
-----

1. Install the required development packages on the host computer.

   a. Open a web browser and download the GNU EFI development
      libraries from the following website:
      https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnu-efi/3.0u+debian-1ubuntu2~12.04.0/+build/5052631

      The source code is unpacked to the ~/grub-2.00 directory.

   b. In a Linux console, enter the following commands:

      .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo dpkg -i gnu-efi_3.0u+debian-1ubuntu2~12.04.0_i386.deb
        $ sudo apt-get install bison libopts25 libselinux1-dev
          autogen m4 autoconf help2man libopts25-dev flex
          libfont-freetype-perlautomake autotools-dev
          libfreetype6-dev texinfo

   c. Install any additional packages listed in the :file:`INSTALL`
      file included with the GRUB2 source code.

2. Download the GRUB2 source code and unpack it.

   a. In a Linux console, enter the following commands to download GRUB2:

      .. code-block:: console

        $ cd
        $ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/grub/grub-2.00.tar.gz

   b. Enter the following command to unpack GRUB2:

      .. code-block:: console

        $ tar -xzf grub-2.00.tar.gz

      The source code is downloaded and unpacked to
      the :file:`~/grub-2.00` directory.

3. Configure and build the :file:`GRUB2 EFI` image.

   a. In a Linux console, enter the following commands to configure GRUB2:

      .. code-block:: console

        $ cd ~/grub-2.00
        $ ./autogen.sh
        $ CFLAGS="-march=i586" ./configure --with-platform=efi
          --target=i386 --program-prefix=""

   b. Enter the following commands to build the :file:`grub.efi` image:
   
      .. code-block:: console

        $ make
        $ cd grub-core
        $ ../grub-mkimage -O i386-efi -d . -o grub.efi -p "" part_gpt
          part_msdos ext2 normal chain boot configfile linux multiboot
          help serial terminal elf efi_gop efi_uga terminfo

      The file :file:`grub.efi` is created in the following directory
      :file:`~/grub-2.00/grub-core`.



Preparing the Boot Device
=========================

Prepare either an SD-micro card or USB flash drive to boot the
Zephyr project on a Galileo board. The
following instructions apply to both devices.


Prerequisites
-------------

* There is access to a Windows host.

* The stripped project image and the GRUB2 image have been copied
  from your Linux host to your Windows host.

* There is a serial port for communication.


Steps
-----

1. Insert the boot device into the Windows host computer,
   and make note of the Drive letter assigned to the device.

2. In the :guilabel:`Windows Computer` folder, right click the boot
   device and select :guilabel:`Format`.

3. Format the boot device with the FAT file system.
   This is typically the default file system type on Windows.

4. Double click the formatted device to open it.

5. Create the following directory tree on the device::

     `-- F:
         |-- efi
         |   |-- boot
         ‘-- kernel

6. Copy the images to the directory tree.

   a. For a microkernel image, copy the file :file:`microkernel.strip`
      to the kernel directory.

   b. Alternatively, for a nanokernel image, copy the file
      :file:`nanokernel.strip` to the kernel directory.

   c. Copy the file :file:`grub.efi` to the boot directory.

7. Create a :file:`GRUB2` configuration file.

   a. In the boot directory, create a text file :file:`grub.cfg`
      that contains the following:

      .. code-block:: console

        set default=0
        set timeout=10
        menuentry "Zephyr Microkernel" {
             multiboot /kernel/microkernel.strip
        }

   b. Alternatively, if you want to use a nanokernel image,
      add the following:

      .. code-block:: console

        menuentry "Zephyr Nanokernel" {
            multiboot /kernel/nanokernel.strip
        }

   The device is ready to use to boot the board.


Booting the Galileo Board
=========================

Boot the Galileo board from the boot device using GRUB2
with the boot loader present in the on-board flash.

.. note::

A stripped project image file is automatically created when the
project is built. The stripped image has removed debug
information from the :file:`ELF` file. 


Prerequisites
-------------

* The automatically created stripped Zephyr project image is
  in the project directory.

* There is a serial port for communication.

  .. note::

    For details on how to connect and configure the serial port,
    see the Getting Started guide that you received with the board.


Steps
-----

1. Insert the prepared boot device (micro-SD card or USB flash
   drive) into the board and start the board.

   The boot process begins and displays a large amount of output.

2. When the following output appears, press :kbd:`F7`:

   .. code-block:: console

     [Bds]BdsWait ...Zzzzzzzzzzzz...
     [Bds]BdsWait(5)..Zzzz...
     [Bds]BdsWait(4)..Zzzz...
     [Bds]Press [Enter] to directly boot.
     [Bds]Press [F7]    to show boot menu options.

3. From the menu that appears, select :guilabel:`UEFI Internal Shell`.

4. At the shell prompt enter:

   .. code-block:: console

     grub.efi

   GRUB2 starts, and a menu shows entries for the items you added
   to the :file:`file grub.cfg`.

5. Select the image you want to boot and press :guilabel:`Enter`.

   When the boot process finishes, you have finished booting the
   Zephyr project.
