File Header Documentation
#########################

Every .c, .h and .S file must contain a file header comment at the
beginning of the file. The file header must contain:

#. The filename. Use **@file** for Doxygen to auto-complete the
   filename.

#. The brief description: A single line summarizing the contents of
   the file. Use **@brief** to clearly mark the brief description.

#. The detailed description: One or multiple lines describing the
   purpose of the file, how it works and any other pertinent
   information such as copyrights, authors, etc.

.. note::

   Doxygen has special commands for copyrights (@copyright), authors
   (@author), and other important information. Please refer to the
   `Doxygen documentation`_ for further details.
