Title: test_context

Description:

This test verifies that the nanokernel CPU and context APIs operate as expected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building and Running Project:

This nanokernel project outputs to the console.  It can be built and executed
on QEMU as follows:

    make qemu

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting:

Problems caused by out-dated project information can be addressed by
issuing one of the following commands then rebuilding the project:

    make clean          # discard results of previous builds
                        # but keep existing configuration info
or
    make pristine       # discard results of previous builds
                        # and restore pre-defined configuration info
