DESCRIPTION
This module contains the entry points for the tasks used by the kernel version
of the mailbox test application. It also initializes global variables that
identify the various kernel objects used by the test code.

Each test task entry point invokes a test routine that returns a success/failure
indication, then gives a corresponding semaphore. An additional task monitors
these semaphores until it detects a failure or the completion of all test tasks,
then announces the result of the test.
