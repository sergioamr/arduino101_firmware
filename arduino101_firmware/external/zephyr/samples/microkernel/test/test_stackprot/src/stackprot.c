DESCRIPTION
  This is the test program to test stack protection using canary.

  For the microkernel version (nanokernel version in brackets):
  The regression (main) task starts alternate task (fiber1), which tries
  to cause a stack check failure scenario, to test this stack check protection
  feature.

  This alternate task (fiber) will not complete it's execution by design and
  thus will not set tcRC to TC_FAIL.  When this alternate task (fiber)
  terminates, control is returned back to the regression (main) task which
  prints out a short string couple times.
