DESCRIPTION
This module is used for the microkernel version of the FPU sharing test,
and supplements the basic load/store test by incorporating two additional
contexts that utilize the floating point unit.

Testing utilizes a pair of tasks that independently compute pi. The lower
priority task is regularly preempted by the higher priority task, thereby
testing whether floating point context information is properly preserved.

The following formula is used to compute pi:

    pi = 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ... )

This series converges to pi very slowly. For example, performing 50,000
iterations results in an accuracy of 3 decimal places.

A reference value of pi is computed once at the start of the test. All
subsequent computations must produce the same value, otherwise an error
has occurred.
