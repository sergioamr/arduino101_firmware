/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 * This file contains test that measures average time needed to do a call
 * to lock the interrupt lock and a call to unlock the interrupts. Typically
 * users calls both of these functions to ensure interrupts are lock while
 * some code executes. No explicit interrupts are generated during the test
 * so the interrupt handler does not run.
