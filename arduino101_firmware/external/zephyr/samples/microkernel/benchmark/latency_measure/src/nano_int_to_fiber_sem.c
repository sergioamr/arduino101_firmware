/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 * This file contains a test which measure switching time from interrupt
 * handler execution to executing a different fiber than the one which got
 * interrupted.
 * The test starts a higher priority fiber (fiberWaiter) which blocks on a
 * semaphore thus can't run. Then a lower priority fiber (fiberInt) is started
 * which sets up an interrupt handler and invokes the software interrupt. The
 * interrupt handler releases the semaphore which enabled the high priority
 * fiberWaiter to run and exit. The high priority fiber acquire the sema and
 * read the time. The time delta is measured from the time
 * semaphore is released in interrup handler to the time fiberWaiter
 * starts to executing.
