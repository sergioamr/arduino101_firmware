/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 * This file contains fiber context switch time measurement.
 * The task starts two fibers. One fiber waits on a semaphore. The other,
 * after starting, releases a semaphore which enable the first fiber to run.
 * Each fiber increases a common global counter and context switch back and
 * forth by yielding the cpu. When counter reaches the maximal value, fibers
 * stop and the average time of context switch is displayed.
