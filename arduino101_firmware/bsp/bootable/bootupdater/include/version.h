 * Define the content of a 48-bytes binary version header.
 *
 * The binary version header allows to uniquely identify the binary used. Note:
 *  - a device may include more than one binary, each having its own binary
 *    version header.
 *  - the position of this struct is usually defined in the linker script and
 *    its content is overwritten after the build (in a special post-build script).
 * It therefore doesn't need to be initialized at compile-time (excepted magic
 * and version), yet can be used in the code at runtime.
 *
 * The binary version header is usually localized at the beginning of
 * the payload, but in the case of e.g. a bootloader, it can also be stored
 * at the end of the payload, or even anywhere within the payload.
 *
 * Major, Minor, Patch are the following the usual definition, e.g. 1.0.0
