Instructions for building HSOTG driver
Portability library will be built on the fly
---------------------------------------
- Export necessary environment variables or pass them to the make command line.

# Path to the installed kernel directory
  % export KDIR=/...
# Architecture type - for HAPS x86_64/x86, for IPMATE ARM
  % export ARCH=x86_64
# If BUS_INTERFACE not exported, PCI_INTERFACE is the default, for IPMATE use LM_INTERFACE
  
- Build the driver.
  % make 

- Install the driver (by default /lib/modules/x.x.xx.x/extra or export INSTALL_MOD_PATH for custom directory)
  % make install
