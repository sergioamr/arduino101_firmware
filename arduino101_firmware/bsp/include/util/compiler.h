  To know which macros are defined please see in compiler-<your_compler>.h
  You'll also find there how to use them.

  In order to use the macro you must include in your code before any other header file
  this compiler.h.
  The correct syntax for that is : #include "util/compiler.h"

  WARNING !! : compiler-<your_compler>.h must never be included directly.
